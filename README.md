# OCRUG Hackathon 2020-04

## Event Summary

The OCRUG Hackathon, hosted by the [Orange County R Users Group](https://ocrug.org) and the [UCI Paul Merage School of Business](https://merage.uci.edu) is a two day event where we will "hack" a data set for fun, education, and prizes.  The focus of the event is on education and teamwork, with the main goal of taking a data set from its "raw" form all the way through to a final "product" (e.g. visualization, model, insight).  To frame this process, we will have a light competitive aspect where teams will present their work at end of the event to a panel of judges, with prizes awarded in several categories (see below).

The event will start with a series of practical educational tutorials to get you started with fundamental data analysis with the R programming language, followed by working sessions where teams will explore and analyze the data set in preparation for the team presentations. Participants will work in small teams (2 - 5 people).  Teams can either be pre-arranged by participants themselves, or will be assigned at the start of the event.  

This event is open to data scientists, enthusiasts and hackers of all levels, from the beginner to the highly experienced.  If you are a beginner, it may be helpful to do some preparatory learning before the event — see the suggested resources below.  If you are an experienced user, we look forward to you sharing your expertise with others. Assisting others, both within and between teams, is highly encouraged.

## Goals of the Hackathon

* The hackathon is primarily an *educational* event, not a competition.  However, the hackathon is framed in the context of a light competition to provide overall structure, including team-based collaboration, the presentation of final work, judging, and prizes.
* *Novice Users*: provide an opportunity to work with a real-world data sets from start (acquire the data) to finish (produce a final “report” on the findings from their work).
* *Experienced Users*: provide an opportunity to practice data analysis skills in a structured environment, interact with others, and assist new users.

## Award Categories and Prizes

See the [presentation guidelines](https://github.com/ocrug/hackathon-2020-04/blob/master/presentation/presentation_guidelines.md) for the requirements. The team prizes will be determined by a panel of judges using the following [judging guidelines](https://github.com/ocrug/hackathon-2020-04/blob/master/admin/judging_guidelines.md).  The judge's decision is final.

Below is a list of the awards and [prizes](https://github.com/ocrug/hackathon-2020-04/blob/master/admin/prizes.md). Winner's will be able to select from the available assortment of prizes.

* Most Helpful Person
    * Personal award
* Best Model
    * Team award
* Best Insight
    * Team award
* Best Visualization
    * Team award

## Most Helpful Person Award

The award for Most Helpful Person Award will be decided by using [cumulative voting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulative_voting) system. In this system, each participant is given 10 votes that they can reward other participants for being helpful.  You can assign multiple points to multiple people. Voting for oneself or one's team members is prohibited. The idea is to award points to individuals on other teams. The person with the most overall votes wins. We will be using an app that you can download from the apple or google app store in order to do the voting. You will need to vote before voting closes at 1:30 PM on Sunday.

We will be using an online voting system. You will receive an email inviting you to create an account so that you can register you votes. The process is the following.
1. You will receive an email inviting you to create an account. It will be from Vox Populi with the subject heading "VoxPopuli - confirm your email"
1. Click an the link in your email and create an account. Make sure that you use the same email address when creating the account as the invite email
1. Once you have your account created, you will be asked to accept an invite to a survey. Accept it.
1. You will now be able to vote once the survey is open. We will announce when it is open

## Saturday Discussion Session

There will be a discussion session Saturday just after supper. The goal is to allow sharing of ideas, knowledge and inspiration between groups. At the top of the hour each team will be presented with a "bingo card" with the names of all the teams on in. The objective is to visit with as many teams as possible to allow cross pollination of ideas and knowledge.  Team-members will visit other teams to hear about what they are doing and share thoughts. Not all team-members need to visit all teams but you should try to visit as many as possible.  Having multiple team-members visit the same team is a good idea.

To make this session run as smooth as possible please

* Have at least one person stay back to talk to incoming participants from other teams. You can have multiple presentors from your team show your work.
* Plan a 2-3 min talk explaining what you have been doing. Share your ideas, insights and thoughts. Also, share your problems and ask for solutions.
* Allow for multiple participants to take part of the conversation at any given group discussion.
* Follow the [Pac-man Rule](https://www.ericholscher.com/blog/2017/aug/2/pacman-rule-conferences/) so that others can be included.
* Remember that the hackathon is primarily an education event and sharing of ideas is highly encouraged.
